## Part 0 (A): Preparation: get RottenPotatoes running locally

The actual RottenPotatoes starter app you will use is in another public repo: [UCCSCS3300/rottenpotatoes-rails-intro](https://github.com/UCCSCS3300/rottenpotatoes-rails-intro). Clone that repo to your homework directory and remove the .git directory inside of the rottenpotatoes-rails-intro folder.

```sh
$ cd /environment/homework
$ git clone https://github.com/UCCSCS3300/rottenpotatoes-rails-intro.git
$ rm -rf /environment/homework/rottenpotatoes-rails-intro/.git
```

Whenever you start working on a Rails project, the first thing you should do is to run Bundler, to make sure all the app's gems are installed.  Switch to the app's root directory (presumably `rottenpotatoes-rails-intro`) and run `bundle install --without production` (you only need to specify `--without production` the first time, as this setting will be remembered on future runs of Bundler for this project).

Finally, get the local database created:

```sh
$ rake db:migrate
```

<details>
  <summary><strong>Self Check Question:</strong> How does Rails decide where and how to create the development database?  (Hint: check the <code>db</code> and <code>config</code> subdirectories)</summary>
  <p><blockquote>The <code>rake db:migrate</code> command creates a local development database (following the specifications in <code>config/database.yml</code>) and runs the migrations in <code>db/migrate</code> to create the app's schema.  It also creates/updates the file <code>db/schema.rb</code> to reflect the latest database schema.  <strong>Note: it's important to keep this file under version control.</strong> </blockquote></p>
</details>
<br />

<details>
  <summary><strong>Self Check Question:</strong> What tables got created by the migrations?</summary>
  <p><blockquote>The <code>movies</code> table itself and the rails-internal <code>schema_migrations</code> table that records which migrations have been run.</blockquote></p>
</details>
<br />

Now insert "seed data" into the database--initial data items that the app needs to run:

```sh
$ rake db:seed
```

<details>
  <summary><strong>Self Check Question:</strong> What seed data was inserted and where was it specified? (Hint: <code>rake -T db:seed</code> explains the seed task; <code>rake -T</code> explains other available Rake tasks)</summary>
  <p><blockquote>A set of movie data which is specified in <code>db/seeds.rb</code></blockquote></p>
</details>
<br />

At this point you should be able to run the app locally (`rails server -b 0.0.0.0`) and navigating to `http://localhost:3000/movies` in your browser.  **For those using Docker Toolbox, go to `http://192.168.99.100:3000/movies` as in prior examples**  **If you are using Codenvy, use the play button and navigate to the link generated within codenvy**.
Note: If you stop the server by hitting control-C, you will no longer be able to visit the RottenPotatoes site. Start the server again by repeating the last command. 

Welcome to RottenPotatoes!
